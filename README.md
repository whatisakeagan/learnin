# My Learnin
This is a repository containing work from my personal education pursuits. As such, it *definitely* does not show my best work. Rather, it serves as evidence of my pursuit of knowledge. Please note that not ***all*** projects/work from each program have been uploaded to this repository; many projects were completed in each service's proprietary course systems, and others were excluded for privacy.

# Note
All work within this repository and elsewhere are my property. Given these programs are online, it's possible you're viewing this repository as someone else currently enrolled in one of these classes. Udacity, edX, and almost every other institution has academic honesty policies (AKA plagiarism policies), and as such copying any work herein violates those policies. But ultimately the biggest consequence will be when you haven't actually learned anything and will be unable to demonstrate your skills. Not to mention you're assuming I knew what I was doing when I was learning these things--your gamble, I suppose!

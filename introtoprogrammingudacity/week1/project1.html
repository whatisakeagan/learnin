  <h1 class="title"> Tigger's Quirks</h1>
  <p> My dog's name being Tigger should tell you that she's not exactly typical. Here's a brief catalog of all the ways
    in which she continues to make be scratch my head.</p>
  <div class="maincontent">
    <h2>How She Got Her Name</h2>
      <div class="howshegothername">
        <div class="media"><video width="320" height="240" controls>
          <source src="media/tiggerbouncing.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div>
        <div class="comment">When I first picked Tigger up and brought her home, her preferred method of locomotion was
          to literally hop around, as opposed to, you know, walking. Given it looked like she was always bouncing on her
          back end, "Tigger" seemed to be an appropriate name. <br><br>
          <div class="footnote">(I realize most people think it should only be a "boy's" dog
          name, but I don't think dogs could possibly care less about gender.)</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    <h2>Her Babies</h2>
      <div class="herbabies">
        <div class="mediaslim"><img src="media/froghug.jpg" alt="Tigger hugging her frog toy" width="240" height="320"></div>
        <div class="comment">Tigger has always had a fascination for her "babies," which are no more than stuffed animals.
          While she would have previously ripped them apart to see the insides (teething, maybe?) she now insists on cuddling
          with at least one whenever she's resting. She also brings them along with her wherever she goes.</div>
      </div>
    <h2>Cuddling & Sleeping</h2>
      <div class="cuddling">
        <div class="mediaslim"><img src="media/cuddler.jpg" alt="Tigger sleeping as typical" width="240" height="320"></div>
        <div class="comment">Tigger is a very needy sleeper--she must be in contact with me in some fashion at practically
          all times. As you can see to the left, this was much cuter when she was a puppy--now it's cute only some of the time.
          Sure, I appreciate the constant heating element in the bed, but having 45 pounds laying on my feet all the time can get
          old. I guess I should just be thankful she only kicks me like a donkey when I've severely disrupte her slumber, and
          that she likes being around me so much.</div>
      </div>
    <h2>Glamour Shots</h2>
      <div class="glamour">
        <div class="media"><img src="media/glamourshot.jpg" alt="Tigger posing for a glamour shot"></div>
        <div class="comment">She can take some adorable photos, no doubt, but she's always had a knack for looking like she's posing
            for a bad 90s glamourshot. Those teeth, man.</div>
      </div>
    <h2>Tennis Balls: More = Better</h2>
      <div class="balls">
        <div class="mediaslim"><img src="media/twoballsheh.jpg" alt="Tigger mouthing her tennis balls" width="240" height="320"></div>
        <div class="comment">Like any good black lab, Tigger LOVES tennis balls. She feels incomplete if there are any less than 2
          in her mouth, and will actively try to catch a ball if she already has one in her mouth, even though it's never worked,
          and she always has to corner it to get both in her mouth at the same time. She is so devoted to her tennis ball cause
          that she rejects the laws of the real world and continues to believe she'll catch that second ball one day.</div>
